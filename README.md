# MeepStudio

## Overview

MeepStudio is a graphical user interface designed for building 2D photonic crystals and lattices. This application serves as the primary focus of a master thesis project, providing an intuitive canvas-based interface for designing photonic structures.

## Purpose

The core functionality of MeepStudio is to facilitate the creation of 2D photonic crystal designs through a visual interface. The application dynamically converts canvas elements into Python code compatible with the MEEP and MPB solvers, enabling users to seamlessly transition from visual design to computational simulation.

Key features include:
- Interactive 2D canvas for photonic crystal design
- Real-time code generation for MEEP and MPB solvers
- Dynamic conversion of graphical elements to Python code
- Automated lattice and structure assembly

## Development Status

This project is currently in active development as part of a master thesis. Features and functionality will be continuously enhanced and expanded throughout the thesis period.

## Additional Content

The repository also contains a Q3 (Quantum QrashQourse) route, which was developed as part of a summer school project. This section demonstrates how an educational association could be organized to promote quantum awareness among young people through interactive learning materials and event coordination.

## Technical Architecture

The application is built using:
- Next.js framework for the web interface
- React components for interactive canvas elements
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Python code generation for MEEP/MPB integration
- WebAssembly components for computational tasks

## Repository Structure

The project follows a monorepo structure with separate applications for the desktop interface, web interface, and backend services, along with shared packages for common functionality.
