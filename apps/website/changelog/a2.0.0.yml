    added:
      - "Added many development-helping scripts. The Makefile can now be used to quickly navigate project development."
    changed:
    fixed:
      - "Fixed GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The deployed static site had a broken UI for the editor. This was due to the tailwind component reading the `.gitignore` file. GH Actions now ignores the `.gitignore` file when building the static site."
